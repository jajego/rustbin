housekeeping
- limit size of headers
- limit # per bin
- do not expire active connections
- uuid parsing
- offer in memory option (As opposed to default sqlite)
- when using sqlite option, prevent a user from viewing another users' bins. this might just look like providing an optional code-protected bucket rather than any jwt auth
- rate limiting

endpoints
- /bin/:id/delete

bugs
- app hangs when provided TRAILER header
